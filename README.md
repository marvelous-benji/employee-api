# employee-api
An CRUD api for employees
<br/>
This is a test driven, authentication based and access controlled
Api, that allows authenticated users to add employees and are only permitted to
update and delete employees which they have added.
This is done to prevent authenticated users from updating
or deleting another user's employee details.
A one to many relationships (from users to employees) database set up is required
to enable such process. The users can be viewed as employers from different companies
